This TODO list is specifically related to the needs of the Qt branch. This is
intended to become the primary TODO list as the conversion finishes.

Priority will attempt to be maintained, but, especially in the conversion
stages, this is a very fluid concept.

ISSUES:

HIGH:
- Create the Item and Spell Browsers as Dockable widget

MEDIUM:
- Allow out-of-party CRE loading
- Allow out-of-party CHR loading
- Implement "Change Portrait"

LOW:
- Gather community support for translating the GUI
- Implement "About"
- Implement webpage tie-in
